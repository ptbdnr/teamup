**AI Agent to Form Aligned Teams**

What makes a great team ‚Äî shared skills, or shared ways of thinking?

Can ideas grow without conversation that challenges and refines them?

Why do we still match by keywords, and brainstorm on blank docs? What if building a team and an idea started with a dialogue ‚Äî one that understood you, questioned you, and connected you? 

**We're building that dialogue.**

## üéØ Project Overview

TeamUP is an AI-powered platform that revolutionizes team formation by moving beyond superficial keyword matching to create meaningful dialogue that aligns people based on complementary thinking patterns, shared values, and collaborative potential.
